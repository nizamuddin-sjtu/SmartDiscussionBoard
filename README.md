## About Me

Hello, I'm Nizamuddin, the creator of the Shared Discussing Board project. As a student or professional engaged in collaborative discussions and brainstorming sessions, I often found the need for a digital solution to recreate the conventional blackboard experience. This led to the development of the Shared Discussing Board Android application.

## Project Overview

The Shared Discussing Board project is my endeavor to bridge the gap between traditional paper-and-pen discussions and the digital world. The Android application serves as a shared electronic board, allowing users to convey their ideas seamlessly. Whether it's during meetings, group discussions, or casual conversations with friends, colleagues, or teachers, this app provides a virtual space to elaborate ideas effectively.

## Features

- **Smart Touch Pen Compatibility:** Users can write on the smart discussion board using a smart touch pen or even their finger, making it intuitive and easy to use.
  
- **Multi-Participant Discussions:** The app supports discussions among more than one participant simultaneously. Each participant is differentiated by their dedicated color-coding, enhancing clarity during collaborative sessions.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nizamuddin-sjtu/shared-discussing-board.git
   cd shared-discussing-board
